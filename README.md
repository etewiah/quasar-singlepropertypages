# SinglePropertyPages

SinglePropertyPages allows you to enter the url of a property listing and create an editable copy that you can publish as a standalone page.

It is built on the amazing [Quasar toolkit](https://quasar.dev/) and uses Vue.js.


## June 2023 update!

I am currently working on a tool to help with house hunting. Would love to get some feedback about it.

Please check it out here and let me know what you think (and if you would like it to be open-sourced):

## Motivation

I started work on this idea over a year ago when I was frustrated with the way a flat I wanted to sell in the UK was being presented.  Regular real estate listings websites almost always have to same template for every property.  The way a property is displayed takes no account of it's particular characteristics.

For me this was frustrating and as I aready built real estate websites for a living I decided to make a product that allows anyone to take a regular property listing and turn it into a single page that presents the property in the best light.

Long story short, I failed to monetize it adequately so rather than letting the idea die completely I decided to create a bare-bones version which I could open source.  Perhaps someone can do a better job of monetizing it than I can.
